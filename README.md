# wsl2-kernel-settings
Here is a custom binary blob for WSL2 kernel 5.9.1 with KVM enabled and built in. Works with AMD, I belive it may also work with Intel, but i have not tested intel.

*I ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOU BUILD YOUR OWN KERNEL*
do not trust a random strangers binary blob from the internet. however i have put it here incase you want to run some testing.
